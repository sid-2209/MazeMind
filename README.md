# MazeMind

**Status:** Under Development  
**Type:** Research Simulation Project  
**Objective:** To explore AI resilience, human-like cognition, and decision-making under extreme survival conditions in a simulated maze environment.

## Overview

MazeMind is a high-fidelity AI simulation designed to test the limits of artificial cognition and adaptability. The project creates a complex virtual maze environment where an autonomous AI agent must survive, adapt, and find its way to the exit under strict physical and psychological constraints.

The environment simulates realistic conditions such as:

- Limited food and water resources  
- Day-night cycles impacting visibility and movement  
- Emotional and cognitive stress factors (e.g., fear, anxiety, hallucination simulation)  
- Risk of “death” through starvation, exhaustion, or poor decision-making  

The AI agent operates with no external assistance or prior map knowledge. It must rely on learned strategies, memory, and adaptive reasoning to navigate, ration resources, and survive until it exits the maze.

## Research Goal

The primary goal of MazeMind is to investigate:

- How AI agents behave under sustained environmental pressure  
- The emergence of human-like adaptive behaviors and planning  
- The relationship between internal state modeling (hunger, fear, fatigue) and decision quality  
- The limits of current AI models in simulating cognitive resilience and emotional response  

This project aims to contribute to the broader study of artificial cognition, emotional modeling, and resilience in autonomous systems.

## Current Status

MazeMind is currently in the conceptual and early development stage.  
Core design elements, simulation architecture, and agent behavior models are being defined and validated before full-scale implementation.

## License

This project will be released under an open-source license once the first functional prototype is complete.
